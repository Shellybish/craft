# Intelligent Auto-Assignment System

## Overview

The intelligent auto-assignment system analyzes team roles, workloads, and availability to automatically assign tasks to the most suitable team members. This implementation completes **Task 2.4: Implement intelligent auto-assignment based on team roles and workload analysis**.

## Core Components

### 1. AutoAssignmentEngine (`src/lib/ai/auto-assignment.ts`)

The main engine that provides intelligent task assignment recommendations.

#### Key Features:
- **Multi-factor scoring algorithm** considering:
  - Skill matching (25% weight)
  - Workload balance (20% weight)
  - Role alignment (15% weight)
  - Performance history (15% weight)
  - Availability (10% weight)
  - Personal preferences (8% weight)
  - Collaboration fit (5% weight)
  - Urgency handling (2% weight)

- **Workload-aware filtering** that excludes overloaded team members (>95% utilization)
- **Comprehensive recommendation engine** providing:
  - Top 3 assignment recommendations per task
  - Confidence scores and reasoning
  - Risk factor identification
  - Alternative options
  - Workload impact analysis

#### Core Methods:

```typescript
// Get assignment recommendations for a task
async getAssignmentRecommendations(
  task: TaskRequirements,
  teamMembers: TeamMember[],
  context?: AssignmentContext
): Promise<AssignmentRecommendation[]>

// Get team workload summary for dashboard
async getTeamWorkloadSummary(
  teamMembers: TeamMember[]
): Promise<TeamWorkloadSummary>
```

### 2. Task Parser Integration (`src/lib/ai/task-parser.ts`)

Enhanced the existing task parser to include auto-assignment capabilities.

#### New Method:

```typescript
async parseMessageWithAssignments(
  message: string,
  context?: {
    userId: string;
    projectId?: string;
    existingTasks?: any[];
    teamMembers?: TeamMember[];
    projects?: Array<{ id: string; name: string; client: string; keywords: string[] }>;
  }
): Promise<TaskParseResult & { assignmentRecommendations: any[] }>
```

This method:
1. Parses tasks from natural language
2. Extracts skills, complexity, and requirements from task content
3. Generates intelligent assignment recommendations
4. Provides complete task + assignment information

## Data Models

### TeamMember Interface

```typescript
interface TeamMember {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  role: UserRole;
  skills: string[];
  currentWorkload: WorkloadData;
  availability: AvailabilityWindow[];
  preferences: AssignmentPreferences;
  performance: PerformanceMetrics;
}
```

### TaskRequirements Interface

```typescript
interface TaskRequirements {
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  skillsRequired: string[];
  roleRequired?: UserRole;
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'urgent';
  estimatedHours: number;
  deadline?: Date;
  projectId?: string;
  complexity: 'simple' | 'medium' | 'complex';
  requiresCollaboration: boolean;
  clientFacing: boolean;
}
```

### AssignmentRecommendation Interface

```typescript
interface AssignmentRecommendation {
  memberId: string;
  memberName: string;
  confidence: number; // 0-1
  reasoning: string[];
  riskFactors: string[];
  alternativeOptions: Array<{
    memberId: string;
    memberName: string;
    confidence: number;
    reason: string;
  }>;
  workloadImpact: {
    newUtilization: number;
    taskLoadIncrease: number;
    estimatedDeliveryDate: Date;
  };
}
```

## Scoring Algorithm Details

### 1. Skill Matching (25% weight)
- Exact skill matches get highest scores
- Partial matches receive proportional scores
- Bonus points for additional relevant skills found in task description

### 2. Workload Balance (20% weight)
- Optimal utilization range: 75-85% (score: 1.0)
- Slight penalty for under-utilization (<75%)
- Heavy penalty for over-utilization (>85%)

### 3. Role Alignment (15% weight)
- Maps task keywords to role-specific capabilities:
  - Project Managers: planning, coordination, management, communication
  - Team Members: development, design, implementation, execution
  - Agency Admins: strategy, oversight, planning

### 4. Performance History (15% weight)
- Weighted combination of:
  - Task completion rate (30%)
  - On-time delivery rate (25%)
  - Quality score (20%)
  - Client satisfaction (15%)
  - Collaboration score (10%)

### 5. Availability (10% weight)
- Checks availability windows cover task timeline
- Scores based on available hours vs. required hours
- Higher scores for more time availability

### 6. Personal Preferences (8% weight)
- Task type preferences
- Urgency level preferences
- Maximum concurrent task limits

### 7. Collaboration Score (5% weight)
- Important for tasks requiring teamwork
- Based on historical collaboration performance

### 8. Urgency Fit (2% weight)
- For urgent tasks, prioritizes members with:
  - Fewer overdue tasks
  - Better on-time delivery history

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems

1. **Context Analyzer**: Uses existing skill extraction and context analysis
2. **Task Parser**: Seamlessly integrates with existing task parsing logic
3. **User Roles**: Leverages existing role-based permission system
4. **Database Schema**: Works with existing user and team structures

### API Integration

The system is designed to work with the existing conversational AI API:

```typescript
// Example usage in chat interface
const result = await taskParser.parseMessageWithAssignments(
  "We need to create UI mockups for the dashboard using Figma",
  {
    userId: currentUser.id,
    projectId: currentProject.id,
    teamMembers: teamMembers
  }
);

// result.tasks contains parsed tasks
// result.assignmentRecommendations contains AI-powered assignment suggestions
```

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite

1. **Auto-Assignment Engine Tests** (`src/lib/ai/auto-assignment.test.ts`)
   - 22 test cases covering all scoring algorithms
   - Mock mode and real implementation testing
   - Edge cases and error handling

2. **Integration Tests** (`src/lib/ai/task-parser-assignments.test.ts`)
   - 9 test cases for parser integration
   - Real-world scenario testing
   - Error handling and graceful degradation

### Test Coverage
- All core algorithms tested with varied scenarios
- Mock team members with different profiles (designer, developer, PM, overloaded member)
- Edge cases like no eligible members, empty teams, etc.

## Performance Considerations

### Efficient Design
- O(n*m) complexity where n = team members, m = scoring factors
- Lazy evaluation of availability windows
- Early filtering of ineligible members
- Configurable mock mode for development/testing

### Scalability
- Designed to handle teams of 10-50 members efficiently
- Scoring weights are configurable
- Supports both real-time and batch processing

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Learn from assignment success rates
2. **Historical Analysis**: Track assignment outcomes to improve scoring
3. **Dynamic Weight Adjustment**: Adjust scoring weights based on project types
4. **Team Collaboration Patterns**: Consider team dynamics and past collaborations
5. **Client Preference Learning**: Factor in client-specific assignment preferences

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Calendar Integration**: Real-time availability from calendar systems
2. **Time Tracking Integration**: More accurate workload calculations
3. **Performance Metrics**: Integration with project management metrics
4. **Notification System**: Automated assignment notifications

## Configuration

### Environment Settings
- Mock mode can be enabled/disabled via constructor
- Scoring weights can be adjusted in the `calculateAssignmentScore` method
- Filtering thresholds are configurable (currently 95% utilization limit)

### Customization Points
- Team member availability windows
- Skill taxonomy and matching rules
- Role-to-task keyword mappings
- Performance metric weights

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- Falls back to basic assignment when AI fails
- Handles missing team member data
- Provides meaningful error messages
- Continues operation when individual assignments fail

### Monitoring
- Comprehensive logging for assignment decisions
- Error tracking for failed assignments
- Performance metrics for scoring algorithms

## Conclusion

The intelligent auto-assignment system provides a sophisticated, AI-powered approach to task assignment that considers multiple factors to optimize team productivity and project success. It integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase while providing extensible architecture for future enhancements.

The implementation successfully completes Task 2.4 and provides a foundation for advanced project management automation in the creative agency context.
